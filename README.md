## 🎯 Design Intentions & Architecture Decisions

### ⏰ Deduplication Time Window Design

**Current Implementation: 1-Hour Windows**
```
Deduplication Key Format: {AlertRule}-{YYYY-MM-DD-HH}
Example: CDN-Availability-Alert-2025-08-08-15
```

#### Why Hour-Based Windows Make Sense for Production

**1. Real Alert Patterns:**
- When infrastructure issues occur (CDN outages, server failures), monitoring systems fire alerts rapidly
- You might receive 10-50 duplicate alerts within the first few minutes of an incident
- Hour-based deduplication ensures ONE ticket per alert type per hour - reasonable for incident management

**2. Alert Storm Prevention:**
- During major outages, systems can generate hundreds of identical alerts
- Hour-based windows prevent ticket flooding while allowing hourly updates for persistent issues

**3. Operational Balance:**
- **Too short (minutes)**: Multiple tickets for the same ongoing issue → operational noise
- **Too long (days)**: Missing recurring issues or resolution/recurrence patterns
- **1 hour**: Sweet spot for most operational scenarios

#### Why Minute-Based Windows Would Be Problematic

**1. Ticket Spam:**
```
15:01 - CDN-Availability-Alert-2025-08-08-15-01 → Ticket INC0001
15:02 - CDN-Availability-Alert-2025-08-08-15-02 → Ticket INC0002  
15:03 - CDN-Availability-Alert-2025-08-08-15-03 → Ticket INC0003
```
Result: Same issue creates 3 tickets in 3 minutes!

**2. Operational Impact:**
- Operations teams overwhelmed with duplicate tickets
- Important alerts lost in the noise
- Incident response becomes chaotic
- ServiceNow performance degradation

#### Testing Considerations

**The Testing Challenge:**
- Hour-based windows are correct for production
- But testing multiple times in the same hour shows "no tickets created"
- This is actually correct behavior - the system is working as designed!

**Testing Solutions:**
1. **Clear deduplication table between tests**: `.\clear-deduplication-table.ps1`
2. **Wait for next hour**: Natural but slow for development
3. **Use different alert names**: Modify test script for unique keys

**Important Note:** If you see "0 tickets created" on the second test run within the same hour, the system is working correctly. The existing deduplication records are preventing duplicate tickets, which is the intended behavior.

## � Quick Start

### Prerequisites

- Azure CLI installed and logged in
- Active Azure subscription  
- Windows PowerShell (for testing scripts) or bash (for deployment)

### 1. Deploy Complete Azure Infrastructure

```bash
# Clone and navigate to project
cd /path/to/your/project

# Deploy complete solution with enhanced security (5-7 minutes)
./deploy.sh
```

### 2. Test the Solution

```powershell
# Run comprehensive tests (PowerShell)
.\test-azure-solution.ps1

# Clear deduplication table for fresh testing
.\clear-deduplication-table.ps1

# Query deduplication records
.\query-deduplication-table.ps1
```

## 📱 Mock ServiceNow Dashboard

Access the web dashboard at: `https://[app-service-url]/dashboard`

### Available Test Scenarios
- **Normal Response**: Standard ticket creation
- **Service Down**: Simulates ServiceNow outage  
- **Auth Failure**: Authentication error simulation
- **Slow Response**: Network latency testing
- **Intermittent**: Random success/failure pattern

### API Endpoints
- `GET /dashboard` - Web control interface
- `POST /api/now/table/incident` - Create incident (matches ServiceNow API)
- `GET /api/health` - Service health check
- `POST /api/test/scenario` - Set test scenario

## 💾 Table Storage Management

### Query Deduplication Records

```powershell
# View all deduplication records
.\query-deduplication-table.ps1

# Clear all records for fresh testing
.\clear-deduplication-table.ps1
```

### Table Schema
```
PartitionKey: DeduplicationKey (e.g., "CDN-Availability-Alert-2025-08-08-15")
RowKey: DeduplicationKey (same as PartitionKey)
Properties: AlertRule, AlertId, ProcessedDateTime, Severity
```

## 🔧 Secure Alert Processing Flow

1. **CDN Alert Generated** → Action Group receives webhook
2. **Logic App Triggered** → Async processing (202 immediate response)  
3. **🔑 Key Vault Authentication** → User-assigned managed identity retrieves storage account key
4. **Deduplication Check** → Query Table Storage for existing record
5. **Decision Logic**:
   - **404 (Not Found)**: New alert → Store record + Create ServiceNow ticket
   - **200 (Found)**: Duplicate alert → Log suppression, no ticket
6. **ServiceNow Integration** → POST to Mock API with incident details
7. **Response Tracking** → Complete processing

### 🛡️ Security Features

- **� Azure Key Vault**: Storage account keys stored securely, never exposed
- **🆔 User-Assigned Managed Identity**: Logic App authenticates to Key Vault with proper audience
- **🔐 RBAC Authorization**: Key Vault uses role-based access control
- **🚫 No Hardcoded Secrets**: All sensitive data retrieved dynamically
- **✅ Enterprise-Grade**: Follows Azure security best practices

## 🛠️ Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

**"No tickets created" on second test run**
- **Expected Behavior**: Deduplication is working correctly!
- **Solution**: Clear deduplication table: `.\clear-deduplication-table.ps1`
- **Why**: Hour-based windows prevent duplicate tickets within the same hour

**Logic App Not Creating ServiceNow Tickets**
- Check Logic App run history in Azure Portal
- Verify deduplication records exist: `.\query-deduplication-table.ps1`
- If records exist but no tickets: Check ServiceNow HTTP action in Logic App runs
- Common issue: ServiceNow API endpoint or authentication problems

**Key Vault Authentication Issues**
- **Error**: `AADSTS500011: The resource principal was not found`
- **Solution**: Verify managed identity has Key Vault access
- **Check**: Azure Portal → Key Vault → Access Policies

**Mock ServiceNow API Timeout**
- Restart App Service: `az webapp restart -g rg-alert-dedup-v2 -n [app-name]`
- Check App Service logs: `az webapp log show -g rg-alert-dedup-v2 -n [app-name]`

### Debug Commands

```bash
# Check Azure resources
az group show -n rg-alert-dedup-v2

# Get webhook URL for Action Group configuration
./get-webhook-url.sh

# Update Action Group with webhook
./update-action-group.sh

# App Service logs
az webapp log tail -g rg-alert-dedup-v2 -n [app-service-name]
```

```powershell
# PowerShell debugging
.\query-deduplication-table.ps1
.\clear-deduplication-table.ps1
.\test-azure-solution.ps1
```

## 📊 Monitoring & Analytics

### Azure Portal Monitoring

## 🛠️ Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

**502 Timeout Errors**
- Solution: Logic App uses async pattern (202 response)
- Background processing prevents timeout

**Action Group Not Triggering**
- Verify webhook URL: `./get-webhook-url.sh`
- Update Action Group: `./update-action-group.sh`

**Key Vault Authentication Issues**
- **Most Common Issue**: Incorrect Key Vault audience
- **Error**: `AADSTS500011: The resource principal named https://vault..vault.azure.net was not found`
- **Solution**: Run `./fix-keyvault-auth.sh` to set correct audience
- Verify Managed Identity: Check Azure Portal → Logic App → Identity
- Wait for RBAC propagation (up to 5 minutes)

**Logic App Not Creating ServiceNow Tickets**
- Check Logic App run history in Azure Portal
- Debug with script: `./debug-logic-app.sh`
- Fix Key Vault authentication: `./fix-keyvault-auth.sh`
- Verify Key Vault secret exists: `az keyvault secret list --vault-name [vault-name]`
- Test Mock ServiceNow directly: `curl https://[app-service-url]/`
- **Common Issue**: Key Vault authentication audience error
  - Solution: Run `./fix-keyvault-auth.sh` to set correct audience
- **Common Issue**: Deduplication records exist but no tickets created
  - Logic App is processing alerts (good!)
  - ServiceNow API call may be failing
  - Check Logic App runs for HTTP action failures

**Mock ServiceNow API Timeout**
- Restart App Service: `az webapp restart -g rg-alert-dedup-keyvault -n [app-name]`
- Check App Service logs: `az webapp log show -g rg-alert-dedup-keyvault -n [app-name]`

**Table Storage Connection**
- Logic App should retrieve storage key from Key Vault automatically
- Check deduplication records: `./query-deduplication-table.sh`
- If records exist, Key Vault integration is working

### Debug Commands
